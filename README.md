# Specification Testing Framework
This is a Specification Testing Framework for Python, designed to showcase understanding of language constructs and create a readable DSL for testing code behavior created for the final project of CSC330.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   git clone https://github.com/aarnav1729/python_internaldsl.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    cd python_internaldsl

3. Optionally, create a virtual environment:
    python3 -m venv venv

4. Activate the virtual environment:
    source venv/bin/activate

## Usage
To run the tests, execute the `specification_testing.py` script:
    python specification_testing.py


## Example Project
In this project, we have included test cases covering various language constructs and features. These tests include:

- Core data types and functionality tests.
- User-defined class and function tests.
- Control flow tests (if statements and loops).
- Data structure tests.
- Exception handling tests.
- Object-oriented concepts tests.
